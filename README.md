# HypothalamicAtlas

This is an atlas of the hypothalamus in 1x1x1mm MNI space based on manual segmentation on T1 images.
Either the whole hypothalamus can be used, or its subunits based on Diffusion-weighted imaging (Anterior-superior, anterior-inferior, intermediate, posterior/mammillary).
The corresponding paper is submitted. Updates will be posted here.
