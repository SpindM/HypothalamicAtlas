# HypothalamicAtlas

This is an atlas of the hypothalamus in 1x1x1mm MNI space based on manual segmentation on T1-weighted images.
Either the whole hypothalamus or its subunits based on Diffusion-weighted imaging (Anterior-superior, anterior-inferior, intermediate, posterior/mammillary) can be used.
The corresponding paper is published in Scientific Reports (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-79289-9).
